// Exercises from Course Material

// HOW:
//    - click RUN
//    - default values for 'a' and 'b' have been provided, but you can change them to change the result

// EXPECTATION:
//    - If 'a' or 'b' is '0', then an error is returned
//    - If both 'a' and 'b' are anything other than '0', the calculations are performed

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    int b = 0;
    
    cout << "Enter the first number - a: ";
    cin >> a;
    cout << a << endl;
    
    cout << "Enter the second number - b: ";
    cin >> b;
    cout << b << endl;
    cout << endl;
    
    if (a == 0 || b == 0) {
        cout << "Divisor can't be 0" << endl;
        throw 0;

    cout << "a / b = " << a / b << endl;
    cout << "b / a = " << b / a << endl;
    cout << "a - b = " << a - b << endl;
    cout << "b - a = " << b - a << endl;
    cout << "a * b = " << a * b << endl;
    cout << "a + b = " << a + b << endl;
    cout << "a % b = " << a % b << endl;
