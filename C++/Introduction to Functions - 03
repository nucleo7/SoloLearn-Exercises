#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// IMPORTANT: You can define a function after it's called, but it must be declared before it's called!

//Function declaration
void printSomething();
void someThing();

int main() {
    printSomething();
    someThing();
}

//Function definition
void printSomething() {
    cout << "Hi there!" << endl;
}

void someThing() {
    cout << "Printing some thing" << endl;
}
