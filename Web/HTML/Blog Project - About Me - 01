               Hey! I'm <strong>John</strong>.
               I'm trying to learn programming, but it's very difficult. <br />
I'm learning as much as I can, and as many different languages and frameworks as possible. Ideally, I would like to focus on JavaScript and web development, but I enjoy <i>C++</i>, <i>Python</i>, and other languages too. <br />
My favourite platform by far is <strong>SoloLearn</strong>. I use, and have used a dozen of others, and nothing else comes close. <br />
Even though I'm struggling, I haven't given up yet.
